Abstract
========

Tools for monitoring and exploring scheduler behavior and survey progress are an important element of Rubin Observatory infrastructure. A variety of users will require these data in the form of tables and visualizations, and require access to them in a variety of contexts and environments. Examples include telescope operators monitoring the scheduler for problems during observing, managers preparing reports for funding agencies, and scientists from science working groups reviewing the effectiveness or survey strategy as implemented. Requirements for tools for creating and providing access to scheduler and survey progress data and visualizations are collected here.
